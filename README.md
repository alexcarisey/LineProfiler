# LineProfiler

Simple line profiler to create vectorial graphs and overlay within Matlab.

Accepts any RGB input (TIFF recommanded).

Stick to the matlab app (v1.1) for the latest stable version as v1.2 is badly broken for now: https://github.com/alexcarisey/LineProfiler/blob/master/RGB%20Line%20Profiler.mlappinstall
